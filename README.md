# repeatr
Working with repetitive code should be easier.

## Quick Info

Repeatr is a tool for generating a `repeating but different` text. I developed repeatr to aid the development of the css framework of Myria Technologies, **Webstone**.

## Usage

Repeatr will replace any `{{$}}` with the defined repeatables, or if you were too lazy to type `{{$}}`, check **Use first repeatables as replace mark** to replace
everything matching the first repeatables.

One picture that explain everything.

## Extras

* Auto copy on windows deactivated.

When checked, the app will copy the content of the result to the clipboard whenever the window is deactivated (`Alt+Tab`, lost focus, changing window, etc.).

* Ctrl+C everywhere.

Pressing `Ctrl+C` will copy the content of the result to the clipboard, unless you have an active text selection.

## Contribution

* Anything that can improve the app.
